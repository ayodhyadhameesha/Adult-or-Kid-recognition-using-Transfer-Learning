# What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique that involves reusing knowledge gained from a pre-trained model on a new, related task. By leveraging the insights and expertise of an existing model, we aimed to boost the accuracy and efficiency of our predictions.

# Project Objectives:

Explore the concept and relevance of Transfer Learning to our problem domain.
Implement Transfer Learning using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and Python.
Improve predictive accuracy by leveraging a pre-trained model's knowledge.
Showcase the project's progress and outcomes through a captivating video demonstration.
